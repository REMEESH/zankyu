              MongoDB : used to store large amount of data permanently

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Difference between SQL and MongoDB
       SQL                                                MongoDB
    ----------------------------                      ------------------------------
    - Relational DBMS                                - Document Oriented NoSQL DBMS
    - store in table with row & column               - Collection of JSON Documnets
    - uses fixed schema(data str.)                   - use dynamic schema
    - used to optimise complex join and              - optimised for scalability and performance
      transaction
    - support rich set of data types                 - limited set of data types 
    - Declarative query language                     - Expressive query  language based on JSON
    - ACID (Atomicity, consistency,                  - NoSQL based on CAP (consistency, availability,
      isolation, durability)                           and partition tolerance)
      property                                         property
    - uses Traditional bussiness application         - used in big data and real time web application    

2. Commands MongoDB - CRUD
  - show databases : display all dbs
  - use db-name : redirect to a particular db
  - show collections : display all collections           
  - find() : to get all Documents from a collection
  - find(condition): to get all Documents which satisfy the condition from a collection  
  - findOne(condition): get only single Document which satisfy the condition else return null   
  - limit(count): to limit Document while reading from db
  - sort(): to sort Document based on any key
  - countDocument(): to get total number of Documents in a collection
  - insertMany(array of Documents): insert more document at the same time 
  - insertOne():insert single document at a time   
  - updateOne(): update single document at a time  
  - updateMany():update  more document at the same time 
  - deleteOne():
  - deleteMany():
  
  - Quering Commands
     -$gt / gte / lt / lte 
     - $and / $or 
     - $eq / $neq
     - $in / $nin
     - $exists
     - $set
     - $push
     - $pull
     
 - Aggregation: Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results
   - $lookup : syntax 
   collection.aggregate({$lookup:
   {
       from: <collection to join>,
       localField: <field from the input documents>,
       foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
       as: <output array field>
     }
   })
  
  3. Mongoose - Mongoose is a MongoDB ODM (Object database Modelling) that is used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node.js server.
     - Collection validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily.
     - Predefined Structure can be implemented on the collection.
     - Constraints can be applied to documents of collections using Mongoose.
